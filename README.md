<p>The most customizable + open source stream scener.<br>
Add scenes, webcams, and screens with ease.<br>
Easily customizable using the ".VEM" mod system.<br>
.vem is just regular JavaScript (if you're used to that.)<br>
I have posted the needed .vem files you will or might need as a baseline.<br>
I have tried to make this the most modular and modifiable project.<br>
Easily customizable with CSS + JavaScript.</p>
