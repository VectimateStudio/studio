The most customizable + open source stream scener.
Add scenes, webcams, and screens with ease.
Easily customizable using the ".VEM" mod system.
.vem is just regular JavaScript (if you're used to that.)
I have posted the needed .vem files you will or might need as a baseline.
I have tried to make this the most modular and modifiable project.
Easily customizable with CSS + JavaScript.
